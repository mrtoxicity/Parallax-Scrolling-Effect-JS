      <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effect</h2>
      <p>
        “Parallax scrolling is a visual effect that mimics depth by making the
        foreground and background elements on a Web page scroll at different
        speeds.” That’s it, in a nutshell. By making things move at different
        speeds, you create depth. Platform games have been employing this
        technique for years, for example making background clouds over faster
        than the foreground. In terms of web design, there are many, many
        examples, but a few we think really capture what it is.
        <br /><br />Like any design trend, it’s impossible to say ‘yes, this
        came from here’. But there are, of course, always going to be
        influences. One major factor for the rise of parallax scrolling has been
        the influential flat design trend. Basically, before flat design, there
        was realism or skeuomorphic design. This emphasizes reflections, drop
        shadows, and a variety of other techniques to give individual icons and
        elements a 3D look. Thus, parallax scrolling, with its objective to give
        depth to 2D objects, doesn’t really work. With flat design being
        decidedly not 3D, all of the sudden, there was a design potential to
        exploit – parallax scrolling. The second factor that accelerated and
        catalyzed parallax scrolling was the single page website. The single
        page website provides a sound base for a parallax experience by
        providing clear information architecture as well as SEO potential. And
        by looking at successful single-scroll website, it’s easy to see the
        creative leap necessary for parallax scrolling to emerge.
        <br /><br />The problem with parallax is that it’s not a great user
        experience. First, the technical complexity required to build parallax
        scrolling is reflected with load time. Parallax sites far more
        frequently require some form of loading screen before they launch. On a
        phone, this delay is even worse, and the challenge becomes promising
        enough value to users to get them to hold on (assuming that it’s a
        positive mobile UX anyways). If there isn’t enough perceived value, the
        user is unlikely to stay until the site loads. Parallax sites, while
        cool, often struggle with conveying information as well. The exception
        is building something akin to an infographic, but conveying information
        in a more conventional way is extremely hard. Parallax sites done well
        can create an awesome experience, but often fail with actionable advice
        or CTAs. For example, a service-based company would struggle to tell its
        audience its core offering through a parallax scroll website. Plus,
        users are forced to scroll through an entire experience, even if what
        they know what they want is at the end. It speaks to a deeper
        ideological challenge with parallax scrolling UX. They’re generally
        sites that are designed to show just how talented the designer is. Which
        is great, but it doesn’t do a great deal for the user.

        <br /><br />All that aside, there are still many positive uses of
        parallax scrolling. At the end of the day they are pretty cool. And for
        something like a brand, an image-heavy website, or experience-based
        advertising (think Red Bull), they’re great. In general, it works better
        if you’re not heavily reliant on organic search and branding is critical
        to achieving your business goals. For example, a business like Sony
        could make an excellent use of a parallax scrolling microsite, and in
        fact they have before. Parallax scrolling is also a great way to
        showcase a particular product. Oakley does a particularly good job of
        this, demonstrating everything about a product in a simple and elegant
        way.
